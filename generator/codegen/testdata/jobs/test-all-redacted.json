{"openapi":"3.0.0","info":{"contact":{"email":"support@arm.com","name":"API Support","url":"https://www.keil.com/"},"description":"This API provides a RESTful interface to all the Solar services e.g. looking for boards, building projects, etc.\n- This API uses Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) to drive the discovery and provide\n  affordances.\n- Discovery is possible by following links from the well known root resource. While this specification lists\n  all supported endpoints, it is only recommended that these are hard coded into a client if code generation is\n  being used. Otherwise, it is recommended that the discovery mechanisms present in the resources (affordances)\n  are used exclusively.\n- Affordances are links which indicate whether an action is currently possible, this is significantly different from\n  whether the service supports an action in general. This specification defines what actions could be possible,\n  but only by checking the affordances returned by the API in the returned resources, can a client determine whether\n  this action is currently possible or available for the current user. For example:\n  - An operation to modify a resource could be defined in this specification, but the user may lack the appropriate\n    privileges. In that situation, the affordance link would not be present in the resource when read. Therefore,\n    the client can infer that it is not possible to edit this resource and present appropriate information to the\n    user.\n  - An operation to delete a resource could be defined and be possible in some circumstances. The specification\n    describes that the delete is supported and how to use it, but the affordance describes whether it is currently\n    possible. The logic in the API may dictate that if the resource was in use (perhaps it is a running job or used\n    by another resource), then it will not be possible to delete that resource as it would result in a conflicted\n    state.\n- It is strongly encouraged that affordances are used by all clients, even those using code generation. This has the\n  ability to both improve robustness and the user experience by decoupling the client and server. For example, if for\n  some reason the criteria for deleting a resource changes, the logic is only implemented in the server and there is\n  no need to update the logic in the client as it is driven by the affordances.\n- The format used for the resources is the Hypertext Application Language (HAL), which includes the definition\n  of links and embedded resources.\n","license":{"name":"Apache 2.0","url":"http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html"},"title":"Solar API","version":"1.1.1"},"servers":[{"description":"Solar API","url":"https://all.api.keil.arm.com"},{"description":"Staging (QA) Solar API","url":"https://all.api.test.keil.arm.com","x-redact":true},{"description":"Local Development Server","url":"http://localhost:8080","x-redact":true}],"paths":{"/":{"get":{"operationId":"getRoot","summary":"Get the Root resource.","description":"Retrieve the Root resource to list top level collections.","parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/ifNoneMatchParam"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/limitParam"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/offsetParam"}],"responses":{"200":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/SimpleCollectionNoLinks"},"304":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/NotModified"},"400":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/BadRequestError"},"401":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/UnauthorisedError"},"406":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/NotAcceptableError"},"429":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/TooManyRequestsError"}},"tags":["Root Resource"]},"parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/acceptVersionParam"}]},"/build-jobs/":{"get":{"operationId":"listBuildJob","summary":"List all Build Jobs.","description":"This returns a collection resource that lists all in progress or recently completed build jobs.
